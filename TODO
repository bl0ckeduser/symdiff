"I have just installed your app which is really good, but it didn't 
solve the equations till the end. Example : cos(x)^2 + sin(x)^2 which 
is simply equals to 1, but as your app try to solve it too which I 
think is good should conclude with zero as it is not. I think you also 
have to focus on arithmetic part of it."

I will probably just have to change the code so that negative signs
get moved to numbers. Differentiating "cos(x)^2+sin(x)^2" gives
"cos(x) * (2 * -sin(x) + 2 * sin(x))" as final result, but  "cos(x)
(2sin(x) +-2*sin(x))"  (with the sign moved) successfully simplifies
to 0.

"lnx" (for "ln(x)") syntax expected, assumed and desired

support for e.g. sin^2(x) would also be nice

the grammar/parser would have to be reworked, perhaps something 
like this:

expr := ... 
	| known_function [ '^' expr ] mul_expr

known_function := 'sin'
		  | 'cos'
		  | ...

The lexical analyser would also need to be adapted, so
it could deal with crazy typing like "lnx"

a separate pass using a trie to split function names out

then the tokenizer would use an identifiers table like in wannabe cc

then the parser would know about this crazy syntax and build the
AST's correctly

	lnx

	|		shorthands.c
	V

	ln x

	|		tokenizer.c
	V

	TOK_KNOWNFUNC:	ln
	TOK_IDENT:	x

	|		parser.c
	V

	(FUNC:ln
		(VARIABLE:x))
	

lnx -> ln(x)
ln^2(x) -> ln(x)^2

goddamn it why don't people properly format their fucking inputs already
all this bullshit

bug in CLI version:	[FIXED; added to sanitychecks.txt]

diff((5*x^3 + 4*x^2) / (e^x + cos(x) * 3*x^2), x)
