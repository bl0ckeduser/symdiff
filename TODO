"I have just installed your app which is really good, but it didn't 
solve the equations till the end. Example : cos(x)^2 + sin(x)^2 which 
is simply equals to 1, but as your app try to solve it too which I 
think is good should conclude with zero as it is not. I think you also 
have to focus on arithmetic part of it."

I will probably just have to change the code so that negative signs
get moved to numbers. Differentiating "cos(x)^2+sin(x)^2" gives
"cos(x) * (2 * -sin(x) + 2 * sin(x))" as final result, but  "cos(x)
(2sin(x) +-2*sin(x))"  (with the sign moved) successfully simplifies
to 0.

"lnx" (for "ln(x)") syntax expected, assumed and desired

bug in CLI version:

diff((5*x^3 + 4*x^2) / (e^x + cos(x) * 3*x^2), x)
