# N'th order derivatives - jan 2016
ndiff(a, b, 0) = 1
ndiff(a, b, 1) = D(b, a)
ndiff(a, b, #n) = diff(ndiff(a, b, n - 1), b)

# this rule is needed because we can't do forward
# references with variable matches. so it is best
# to have the variable of differentiation come first
diff(a, b) = D(b, a)
