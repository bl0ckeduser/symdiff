==============================================================================
	This is a symbolic differentiation program
	
   It features an infix REPL, a tree pattern-matcher/substitutor,
   and some preloaded derivative rules (the fanciest of which is
   probably the chain rule)

   This is a toy/self-education project by "blockeduser", started May 2013.
   It is very far from perfect and could be improved upon.
   It is coded in hopefully-not-too-bad C.

   Much of it is strongly based on examples given in the SICP 
   ("Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs") book and videos
==============================================================================

Program use
-----------

The program is a REPL. Equations are taken as rules and added to the list 
of known rules. Expressions are reduced using the set of rules known so
far. When an expression typed in cannot be reduced, nothing is printed back.

All the lines of all the files in the directory "rules" will be loaded 
as rules at startup, automatically. Some basic derivative, trigonometry, and
algebraic simplification rules are already included. Derivatives are
taken through the syntax 'diff(expression, variable)'.

Many algebraic simplifications are also "hard-coded" into the program.

(The directory "pres-rules" contains rules for presentation of results).

The file "SYNTAX" describes the syntax used for rules and expressions.

To take derivatives, the syntax is diff(expression, variable).

		***************************************

Here are some quick examples:

]=> diff(log((1+x)*(1+x^2)^2*(1+x^3)^3), x)
(1 + (1 + x) * (9 * x ^ 2) / (1 + x ^ 3) 
	+ (1 + x) * (4 * x) / (1 + x ^ 2)) / (1 + x)

]=> diff(sin(x * cos(x + log(x))), x)
cos(x * cos(x + log(x))) * (-1 * x * sin(x + log(x)) 
	* (1 + 1 / x) + cos(x + log(x)))

]=> diff(e^u + e^(cos(u) * sin(u)), u)
e ^ u + e ^ (cos(u) * sin(u)) * (cos(u) ^ 2 + -sin(u) ^ 2)

]=> diff(z^log(sqrt(z)) * z / cos(z), z)
(z ^ (log(z) / 2) * (1 + log(z))) / cos(z) + z ^ (log(z) / 2) 
	* cos(z) ^ -2 * z * sin(z)

]=> diff(z^z^z, z)
z ^ (z ^ z) * (log(z) * z ^ z * (1 + log(z)) + z ^ (z - 1))

]=> diff(z^x^y, x)
z ^ (x ^ y) * x ^ (y - 1) * log(z) * y

Acknowledgements
----------------

This program is based on three things:

	1) The SICP video about pattern matching
	   ("4A: Pattern Matching and Rule-based Substitution",
	    available on MIT's website via an excessively long URL)

	2) The SICP text example about symbolic differentiation
	   http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/sicp/book/node39.html

	   The file 'rules/basic-deriv-rules' contains exactly the 
	   derivative rules presented in that example, rewritten in 
	   this program's syntax. Credit is given in the rule-file's
	   comments, of course.

	3) My wannabe parser/compiler project from december 2012
		(itself based on my wannabe-regexes from
		 august 2012, which handle the lexing)
	   This makes the infix REPL interface possible.
	   The bulk of the code in this program is from that project.

Bugs
----

- Matcher can't deal with certain patterns, see file 'SYNTAX'.
  This isn't a user-facing bug, really, especially not the locked-down GUI

Fixed bugs
----------

- Memory leakage over time; nothing is ever really free()d. (Might fix one day)
  UPDATE: now fixed via a cheapo GC.
  Compile with the flag LEAK_STRESS_TEST and the program will run in a loop 
  constantly doing the derivative 'diff(z^z^z, z)'. Memory usage stays
  stable over time.
- Rather inefficient. On a 400 MHz system, the command 'diff(x^2, x)' 
  took 1.667 second to complete, and the command
  'diff(z^log(sqrt(z)) * z / cos(z), z)' took 38.728 seconds.
  UPDATE: since commit 147cdea87850438bd2006e54389a0c594d19cf99,
  these times have shrunk to 0.135s and 0.737s respectively :)
- Parser crash (segfault) on certain instances of illegal syntax 
  (I should really fix this)
  actually i think this has been fixed, kudos to knipil, some bluemoons ago
  refer commit b56d81008ce068935029aa1600e5c28e1d368856

Notes
-----

Unfortunately, there are several other projects by other people with
the same name, for example one which is a GPL'd a symbolic differentiator
dating to 2003; one which is a commercial symbolic differentiator;
and one which is a serious research project in a different field.

I'm not trying to steal anybody's trademarks. I'm just trying to write
code for fun and learning.

Also, I've made a closed-source-freeware step-by-step derivatives GUI
desktop application based on this code. It is available at:

   https://sites.google.com/site/bl0ckeduserssoftware/easyderivsteps

There's now also a Windows 8 "app" version of the step-by-step GUI available:

   http://sites.google.com/site/bl0ckeduserssoftware/ssdc_w8

Developing this app was somewhat of an interesting challenge.
Tip: "Visual Studio 2012" needs a few GB of RAM to operate happily.
